# Nmap-Automated
nmap script that automates scanning as well as scanning for vulns.
Helpful for scanning on HTB and OSCP practice machines.

In-Progress:
Fixing errors with checking CVEs as well as goBuster when in use on certian networks that redirect.

Disclaimer:
Script was not originally created by me. 
Debugging updates will be posted here.
